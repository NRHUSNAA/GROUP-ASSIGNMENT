It is one of the rising fashion companies at that time of early 2010s. This company was founded by Nur Alwani or Wanie Elena and Ahmad Shafiq Hilmi. Wani was a student at that time while Syafiq was working as a tutor. As they both want to focus on their business, they quit both studying and tutoring jobs to become full-time entrepreneurs. They just started their business with only 3 staff at that time but their hard work pays off as they now have been recognized as one of the successful fashion companies in Malaysia.They initiated their business through online and social media platforms. In 2017, they opened an office and warehouse in Setia Alam, Selangor. They have been operating their business only and then In 2019, they opened their first boutique in Shah Alam, which is one of the most popular Hari Raya haul hubs in Malaysia, apart from Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman in Kuala Lumpur.</p></font>
